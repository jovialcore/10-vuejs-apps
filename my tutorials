How to set up vue dev tools for vuejs 3 
1, as of the time of writing this post, due to compatibility issues, downloading vuejs dev tools directly from firefox extension market place will not work outrighlty. 
Upon activated, you may be having pop up like "vuejs not detected"

To solve this, 
you will have to download vuejs dev tools beta version via this link and its highly recommended. See this "https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools/issues/1279" Please accept all the permissions requirements that pops up while you are trying to donwload the extension on firefox.

2. Once its activated, disbale the vuejs (not beta version) if you have already installed it.

3. restart your firefox browser and thats it. You are good to go.

## what are computed properties in vuejs ##

  //computed properties lets vuejs first set all the values, then acts on the set values..LIke it allows the app to SET all values then acts on the SETTED values.
        //so computed properties is simply having the data SETTED and then you can represent the values as DATA property inyour text interpolation.. So you compute stuff and treat it as a propery
//you can use computed properties as data but in method format 
//method is usually when you want to do stuff based on events...Thats what methods kind of looks like though



virtual dom is the copy of the html contents into the memory o vuejsVdom is in memory and very light


  //life cycle hooks..vuejs lifecycle hooks enables you to have full control of the virtual dom...You can manipulate the different virtual dom changes before app is created, beofore mounting, unmounting, etc
 
//before unmounted : changing the component means changing the dom and thereby means unmounting

// i learnt how to use event instances like (emits)to work across mulitple components. You basically use them to create custom event handlers as much as you want...
